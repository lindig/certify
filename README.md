# Certify

This is a small project to create a self-signed SSL certificates for a
host. It is not comprehensive and I wrote it mostly to familiarise
myself with the X509 API.

* Top-level Makefile for convenience: just say `make` but the actual
  build is managed by Dune
* Minimal command-line handling set up
* GitHub Actions CI ready
* Code is in Public Domain
